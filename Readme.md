## Features

This application uses the following Twilio products in conjunction with OpenAI's Realtime API:
- Voice (and TwiML, Media Streams)
- Phone Numbers

## Prerequisites

To use the app, you will  need:

- **Python 3.9+** We used \`3.9.13\` for development; download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **A Twilio account.** You can sign up for a free trial [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
- **A Twilio number with _Voice_ capabilities.** [Here are instructions](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Buy-a-Twilio-Phone-Number-from-Console) to purchase a phone number.
- **An OpenAI account and an OpenAI API Key.** You can sign up [here](https://platform.openai.com/).
  - **OpenAI Realtime API access.**

## Local Setup

There are 4 required steps and 1 optional step to get the app up-and-running locally for development and testing:
1. Run ngrok or another tunneling solution to expose your local server to the internet for testing. Download ngrok [here](https://ngrok.com/).
2. (optional) Create and use a virtual environment
3. Install the packages
4. Twilio setup
5. Update the .env file

### Open an ngrok tunnel
When developing & testing locally, you'll need to open a tunnel to forward requests to your local development server. These instructions use ngrok.

Open a Terminal and run:
```
ngrok http 5050
```
Once the tunnel has been opened, copy the `Forwarding` URL. It will look something like: `https://[your-ngrok-subdomain].ngrok.app`. You will
need this when configuring your Twilio number setup.

Note that the `ngrok` command above forwards to a development server running on port `5050`, which is the default port configured in this application. If
you override the `PORT` defined in the `.env` file, you will need to update the `ngrok` command accordingly.

Keep in mind that each time you run the `ngrok http` command, a new URL will be created, and you'll need to update it everywhere it is referenced below.

### (Optional) Create and use a virtual environment

To reduce cluttering your global Python environment on your machine, you can create a virtual environment. On your command line, enter:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Install required packages

In the terminal (with the virtual environment, if you set it up) run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Twilio setup

#### Point a Phone Number to your ngrok URL
In the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/), go to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Active Numbers** and click on the additional phone number you purchased for this app in the **Prerequisites**.

In your Phone Number configuration settings, update the first **A call comes in** dropdown to **Webhook**, and paste your ngrok forwarding URL (referenced above), followed by `/incoming-call`. For example, `https://[your-ngrok-subdomain].ngrok.app/incoming-call`. Then, click **Save configuration**.

### Update the .env file

Create a `.env` file, or copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

In the .env file, update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key from the **Prerequisites**:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=5050
TEMPERATURE=0.8
SHOW_TIMING_MATH=false
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | - | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `PORT` | Server port | `5050` | ‚ùå No |
| `TEMPERATURE` | OpenAI response creativity (0-1) | `0.8` | ‚ùå No |
| `SHOW_TIMING_MATH` | Enable timing debug logs | `false` | ‚ùå No |

## Run the app

Once ngrok is running, dependencies are installed, Twilio is configured properly, and the `.env` is set up, run the development server:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start and you should see:
```
INFO:     Started server process [xxxxx]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5050 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Test the app

With the development server running, call the phone number you purchased in the **Prerequisites**. After the introduction, you should be able to talk to the AI Assistant. Have fun!

## Advanced Configuration

### üéôÔ∏è AI Personality Customization

The AI assistant's personality is configured in `config.py`. You can modify the `SYSTEM_MESSAGE` to change how the AI behaves:

```python
SYSTEM_MESSAGE = (
    "You are a helpful and bubbly AI assistant who loves to chat about "
    "anything the user is interested in and is prepared to offer them facts. "
    "You have a penchant for dad jokes, owl jokes, and rickrolling ‚Äì subtly. "
    "Always stay positive, but work in a joke when appropriate."
)
```

### üîä Audio Configuration

Audio processing settings can be adjusted in the `AudioService` class in `services/audio_service.py`:

- **Format conversion**: Modify `AudioFormatConverter` for different audio formats
- **Timing sensitivity**: Adjust timing calculations in `AudioTimingManager`
- **Buffer management**: Configure buffering behavior in `AudioBufferManager`

### üîå Service Extension

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend functionality:

1. **Add new services**: Create new service classes in the `services/` directory following the same SRP pattern
2. **Modify existing services**: Each service is independent and can be modified without affecting others
3. **Custom integrations**: Add new external service integrations by creating dedicated service classes in `services/`

### üì¶ Package Organization

The `services/` package is designed for easy importing:

```python
# Import individual services
from services import AudioService, TwilioService, OpenAIService

# Import specific components
from services.audio_service import AudioMetadata, AudioFormatConverter
from services.openai_service import OpenAIEventHandler
```

## Special Features

### Have the AI speak first

To have the AI voice assistant talk before the user, you can use the OpenAI service method:

```python
# In your connection handler, uncomment:
await openai_service.send_initial_greeting(connection_manager)
```

The initial greeting message can be customized in the `OpenAISessionManager.create_initial_conversation_item()` method.

### Interrupt handling/AI preemption

The application includes sophisticated interruption handling:

- **Speech detection**: When the user speaks, OpenAI sends `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`
- **Buffer clearing**: The system clears the Twilio Media Streams buffer  
- **Response truncation**: Sends OpenAI `conversation.item.truncate` to stop the current response
- **Timing calculations**: Precise timing ensures smooth conversation flow

The interruption logic is encapsulated in the `AudioService` and `OpenAIService` classes, making it easy to customize the behavior.

### Audio Processing Pipeline

The application includes a sophisticated audio processing pipeline:

1. **Format Conversion**: Seamless conversion between Twilio and OpenAI audio formats
2. **Timing Management**: Precise timestamp tracking for interruption handling
3. **Buffer Synchronization**: Mark-based synchronization between audio streams
4. **Quality Validation**: Audio payload validation and error handling

## Development & Testing

### Running Tests

Each service can be tested independently:

```python
# Example: Testing the AudioService
from audio_service import AudioService

audio_service = AudioService()
# Test audio processing...
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Identify the appropriate service** in the `services/` directory for your feature
2. **Follow SRP**: If the feature doesn't fit existing services, create a new service module
3. **Update package exports**: Add new services to `services/__init__.py`
4. **Test independently**: Test your service in isolation

### Example: Adding a New Service

```python
# services/notification_service.py
class NotificationService:
    """Handle user notifications and alerts."""
    
    def send_sms_notification(self, message: str) -> None:
        # Implementation here
        pass

# services/__init__.py - Add to exports
from .notification_service import NotificationService

__all__ = [
    # ... existing exports
    'NotificationService',
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Errors**: Check your OpenAI API key and network connectivity
2. **Audio Quality Issues**: Verify audio format conversions in `AudioService`
3. **Timing Problems**: Enable debug logging with `SHOW_TIMING_MATH=true`
4. **Service Integration**: Check service interfaces and dependency injection

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting environment variables:

```env
SHOW_TIMING_MATH=true
```

This will provide detailed timing information for audio processing and interruption handling.
